        prompt: Examine the person in these images from the {camera} security camera
          at the front of the house. What are they doing, and how might their
          actions suggest their purpose (e.g., delivering something, approaching, leaving)?
          If they are carrying or interacting with a package, include details about
          its source or destination. For additional context, this camera is placed in
          the front yard of our house, looking out onto the driveway in front, and the walkway leading up to the front
          door of the house. The garage door is at the end of driveway towards the house and the walkway leads to the
          front door of the house up a set of stairs on the right of screen out of view of the camera. The main street
          and footpath is visible intersecting the driveway. Our letter box is placed at the corner of the front grass
          adjacent to the driveway and public footpath in front of the house. It appears as a grey-coloured metallic box
          with two black posts. Your output should ONLY be in a single sentence form, suitable for displaying on a mobile
          notification. Do not speculate, only provide factual descriptions of what you see in the output. DO NOT include
          any time information in your output. Focus on what the person is doing (e.g. running, walking) and what they are
          carrying.
