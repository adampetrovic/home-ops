# Restore / Bootstrap

**WARNING:** This is purely theoretical and hasn't been tested. It's likely some of the steps won't work correct and you will need to debug

### Nuking Existing Cluster

1. Wipe the existing rook-ceph disks on the cluster (skip if a new cluster)
   ```
   task rook:reset cephnodes="k8s-node-1 k8s-node-2 k8s-node-3 k8s-node-4" cephdisk="/dev/nvme0n1"
   ```
2. Reset the cluster
   ```
   task talos:hard-nuke
   ```

### Bootstrapping New Cluster

At this point the cluster should be in maintenance mode with everything reset to defaults. Now we need to bootstrap the cluster to get it ready for workloads.

1.  Deploy your cluster and bootstrap it.  This generates secrets, generates the config files for your nodes and applies them. It bootstraps the cluster afterwards, fetches the kubeconfig file and installs Cilium and kubelet-csr-approver. It finishes with some health checks.

    ```
      task talos:bootstrap
    ```

2. ‚ö†Ô∏è It might take a while for the cluster to be setup (10+ minutes is normal), during which time you will see a variety of error messages like: "couldn't get current server API group list," "error: no matching resources found", etc. This is a normal. If this step gets interrupted, e.g. by pressing `Ctrl + C`, you likely will need to nuke the cluster before trying again.

3. Move the kubeconfig file that's generated to the global directory
    ```
    mv kubeconfig ~/.kube/config
    ```

4. Verify the nodes are online

    ```sh
    kubectl get nodes -o wide
    # NAME           STATUS   ROLES                       AGE     VERSION
    # k8s-0          Ready    control-plane,etcd,master   1h      v1.29.1
    # k8s-1          Ready    worker                      1h      v1.29.1
    ```

### Install Flux in the cluster

1. Verify Flux can be installed

    ```sh
    flux check --pre
    # ‚ñ∫ checking prerequisites
    # ‚úî kubectl 1.27.3 >=1.18.0-0
    # ‚úî Kubernetes 1.27.3+k3s1 >=1.16.0-0
    # ‚úî prerequisites checks passed
    ```

1. Install Flux and sync the cluster to the Git repository

    üìç _Run `task flux:github-deploy-key` first if using a private repository._

    ```sh
    task flux:bootstrap
    # namespace/flux-system configured
    # customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/alerts.notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io created
    # ...
    ```

1. Verify Flux components are running in the cluster

    ```sh
    kubectl -n flux-system get pods -o wide
    # NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    # helm-controller-5bbd94c75-89sb4            1/1     Running   0          1h
    # kustomize-controller-7b67b6b77d-nqc67      1/1     Running   0          1h
    # notification-controller-7c46575844-k4bvr   1/1     Running   0          1h
    # source-controller-7d6875bcb4-zqw9f         1/1     Running   0          1h
    ```

### Verification Steps

In a few moments applications should be lighting up like Christmas in July üéÑ

1. Output all the common resources in your cluster.

    üìç _Feel free to use the provided [kubernetes tasks](.taskfiles/Kubernetes/Taskfile.yaml) for validation of cluster resources or continue to get familiar with the `kubectl` and `flux` CLI tools._

    ```sh
    task kubernetes:resources
    ```

2. ‚ö†Ô∏è It might take `cert-manager` awhile to generate certificates, this is normal so be patient.

### Final Step

1. If there are volsync backups already configured at the locations your PVCs specify, then they should start being hydrated from the last snapshot. Confirm your apps have their data restored after they start!
